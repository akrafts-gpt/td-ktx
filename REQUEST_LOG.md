# Feature Request Log

A running log of user-requested business logic changes. Update this file with each new feature request.

- Add a tabbed main screen with separate "User Online" and "Threads" sections.
- Build a Threads tab that aggregates discussions from public group chats by scanning recent messages and reply chains.
- Display threads as rooted messages followed by their replies, loading results incrementally per chat.
- Show sender names in bold prefix ("Name: message") for thread roots and replies.
- Render photos contained in messages within the Threads UI.
- Avoid listing replies as separate top-level threads when they already appear under another thread.
